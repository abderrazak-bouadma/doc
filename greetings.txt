Discussion on Security and Operational Measures for the CIS Platform

1. IT Security Teamâ€™s Role in the Architecture Process
Context:
The CIS platform is hosted in a private cloud and operates under strict legal constraints, including compliance with ANSSI restrictions and LPM (2024-2027). The platform is fully isolated, without direct ingress or egress internet communication, relying on an intermediary platform for external interactions.
Security Team Responsibilities:
Security Requirements Integration: Early involvement in defining security policies and ensuring they align with ANSSI and LPM regulations.
Compliance and Regulatory Alignment: Continuous collaboration with legal and compliance teams to enforce security measures.
Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling: Identifying attack vectors and implementing mitigations tailored to the isolated environment.
Security Controls and Hardening: Implementing robust network segmentation, strict access controls, and encryption.
Vulnerability Management and Testing: Conducting regular penetration testing and audits.
Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response: Establishing logging, alerting, and forensic analysis processes.
Cross-Team Collaboration: Ensuring consistent security application throughout the platform lifecycle.
Documentation and Training: Developing security policies and training personnel on operational procedures.
Adaptive Security Review: Regularly updating security protocols based on emerging threats and regulatory changes.


2. Ensuring Package Integrity During Manual Transfer
Context:
CI processes generate application packages, which must be manually transferred to the CIS platform for processing and deployment.
Integrity Assurance Measures:
Cryptographic Hashing: Using SHA-256 for integrity verification before and after transfer.
Digital Signatures: Signing packages with GPG or PKI to confirm authenticity.
Secure Transfer Protocols: Employing SFTP or HTTPS for secure file movement.
Artifact Repository with Integrity Checks: Utilizing repositories that enforce automated checksum verification.
Manual Verification Procedures: Requiring security personnel to validate package integrity.
Audit Logging and Traceability: Maintaining logs to track transfer history and changes.
Redundant Validation Checks: Implementing a dual-validation mechanism.
Immutable Build Artifacts: Preventing modifications post-build by marking artifacts as immutable.


3. Applying CVE Patches and Hardening Strategies
Context:
The CI platform builds VM images that are manually transferred to the CIS environment. Patch management and additional security measures must be ensured.
Patch Management and Hardening Steps:
Automated CVE Patch Integration in CI: Keeping base images updated in the CI pipeline.
Immutable Artifact Strategy: Ensuring no post-build modifications to certified images.
Secondary Hardening Verification in CIS: Conducting independent security scans within the CIS.
Post-Build Vulnerability Scanning: Running automated checks on built images.
Manual Verification and Audit Trails: Implementing a mandatory security checklist.
Layered Security Controls: Enforcing strict access, configuration baselines, and runtime monitoring.
Compliance and Regulatory Alignment: Ensuring all patching steps align with ANSSI and LPM standards.
Continuous Improvement Process: Periodically reviewing and re-hardening images as new CVEs emerge.


4. Chaos Testing the CIS Platform
Context:
Given the criticality of the CIS platform, testing its resilience through controlled disruptions (Chaos Engineering) can help identify weaknesses.
Proposed Chaos Testing Approach:
Define Scope & Objectives: Specify test coverage (infrastructure, applications, security controls).
Select a Framework: Use tools like Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, or LitmusChaos tailored for private, air-gapped environments.
Simulate Failures: Conduct controlled disruptions, such as:
Network isolation scenarios
Component failures (e.g., VM crashes, storage unavailability)
Load-based stress tests
Monitor & Analyze: Implement logging and real-time monitoring to detect abnormal behaviors.
Develop Mitigation Strategies: Create automated recovery plans for detected vulnerabilities.
Iterate & Improve: Continuously refine resilience strategies based on test results.


5. Additional Security Measures for ANSSI Compliance
1. Air-Gapped Security Validation
Air-Gap Enforcement Validation: Perform periodic checks to confirm no unintended data leaks between CIS and external environments.
Data Flow Control: Ensure the intermediary platform enforces strict logging, monitoring, and limited transfer operations.
2. Supply Chain Security
Third-Party Component Verification: Enforce SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) analysis to track all dependencies.
Tamper-Proof Build Process: Ensure only approved build environments generate the software used in CIS.
Developer and Maintainer Validation: Implement strict identity verification for CI/CD actors and package maintainers.
3. Cryptographic Security & Key Management
Dedicated HSM (Hardware Security Module): Ensure private keys never leave the secured perimeter and cryptographic operations occur in an HSM.
Key Rotation and Expiry Policies: Enforce short-lived cryptographic material, rotated automatically via an offline process.
Mandatory End-to-End Encryption: Use AES-256 encryption for all stored and in-transit data within CIS.
4. Zero Trust & Identity Management
Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign granular access levels for both humans and services.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey) for administrative access.
Privileged Access Monitoring: Continuously monitor, record, and audit all privileged sessions.
5. Advanced Monitoring & Intrusion Detection
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Deploy an air-gapped SIEM to analyze security logs within CIS.
Behavior-Based Anomaly Detection: Implement AI-based anomaly detection to flag abnormal patterns.
Automated Forensic Readiness: In case of a breach, ensure all logs and forensic data are instantly available for analysis.
6. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Code Security Scanning: Mandate SAST/DAST analysis (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk) before package approval.
Memory Safety Enforcement: Restrict development to memory-safe languages where possible (Rust over C/C++).
7. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
Immutable Backups: Maintain offsite, write-once-read-many (WORM) backups that are periodically verified.
Red Team Testing & Cyber Drills: Regularly conduct ANSSI-aligned penetration tests and cyber wargames.
8. Physical Security Hardening
Strict Datacenter Access Controls: Enforce biometric access and video surveillance.
Faraday Cage Protection: Shield critical equipment from electromagnetic interference and RF attacks.

Conclusion: The CIS platform must integrate multi-layered security measures, robust integrity validation processes, structured CVE patching workflows, and rigorous ANSSI compliance strategies. Additionally, incorporating controlled chaos testing and continuous monitoring can further enhance resilience and operational stability.
