Below is a very rough, ball‐park estimation of the weekly hours that might be spent on each major task. Keep in mind that these figures can vary greatly depending on the size, complexity, automation, and incident frequency of your data center:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:**  
  Approximately **5–10 hours per week**. This includes reviewing system dashboards, logs, and performing physical rounds (if required). Automation can lower the manual effort, but manual checks are still common during shift handovers.

- **Routine (Preventive) Maintenance:**  
  Around **3–5 hours per week**. This covers activities like cleaning, hardware inspections, checking UPS/battery statuses, and performing scheduled preventive tasks.

- **Incident Management & Troubleshooting:**  
  Roughly **3–5 hours per week** on average. In quieter periods, this might be on the lower end, but it can spike during an outage or critical incident.

- **Security Operations & Compliance Checks:**  
  About **2–3 hours per week**. This includes verifying access logs, reviewing security system alerts, and performing compliance or audit checks.

- **Software Updates & Patch Management:**  
  Estimated at **2–4 hours per week**. This encompasses planning, testing, and applying updates or patches to the management software and related systems.

- **Administrative & Reporting Tasks:**  
  Around **2–3 hours per week**. Activities include shift handover documentation, updating ticket status reports, and other routine administrative duties.

Adding these together, a technician (or team member covering multiple roles) might dedicate roughly **17–30 hours per week** on direct operational tasks. 

Remember, these are only the “active work” hours. In a 24×7 environment, staffing models need to account for shift coverage (which might involve multiple technicians to cover the same function) and on-call duties, so the total headcount required may be higher even if each technician’s focused work adds up to this range.

These numbers provide a starting point to help justify FTE staffing, but they should be adjusted based on your actual workload, automation levels, and any unique operational requirements your data center might have.

Using a simple rule‐of‐thumb based on both the workload and the need for 24×7 coverage, here’s one way to think about it:

1. **Workload Estimate:**  
   For a small data center where daily tasks (monitoring, preventive maintenance, incident response, etc.) might total roughly 17–30 “active” work hours per week, a single technician working a standard 40‑hour week could easily cover those tasks during normal business hours.

2. **Shift Coverage (24×7):**  
   However, to cover 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (168 hours per week), you must account for all shifts. In a pure 24×7 on‐site model without relying on overtime or extensive remote monitoring, you would need:
   \[
   \frac{168 \text{ hours/week}}{40 \text{ hours/FTE}} \approx 4.2 \text{ FTEs}
   \]
   Rounding up, that suggests about 4–5 full‑time staff to ensure that someone is always on site and fully supported.

3. **Considering Automation & Remote Monitoring:**  
   If your data center uses robust automation, remote monitoring, and a well‑designed on‐call rotation (where a smaller number of staff handle issues outside business hours), you might be able to cover the workload with around 3 FTEs.  
   – For example, you might have 2 FTEs during business hours with one additional technician on a rotational on‑call basis for after‐hours support.

4. **VM Scale Impact:**  
   With 250–300 VMs—a relatively modest environment—the overall operational workload is lighter than that of a large hyperscale center. This helps keep the staffing needs low.

**In summary:**  
- For full on‑site, no‑overtime 24×7 coverage, you’d likely need **4–5 FTEs**.  
- With remote monitoring and a flexible on‑call arrangement, you might manage with **around 3 FTEs**.

Ultimately, the exact number depends on factors such as your level of automation, the specific incident frequency, and whether you choose to use on‑call or overtime strategies. This ball‑park figure should serve as a starting point for your staffing model.
